                to protect Fiordland national park are through comunity led projects, involvement in invasive speices
                management, resposible tourism, sustainable practices, awareness, financial support, and respecting
                culture.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Participate on local restoration programs</li>
            <li>Join native tree planting programs, this helps by getting more native trees in the area, helping to make
                it closer to what it used to be</li>
            <li>Support predator control efforts, this could be setting up traps for pests, to lower their numbers and
                prevent them from killing birds and native species</li>
            <li>Volenteer for habitat rehabilitation efforts</li>

        <h3>Invasive Species Management</h3>
        <p>Managing the amount of pests and invase species is important because these pests kill many native birds, and
            also eat their eggs too, which causes New Zealands bird numbers to decrease significantly. Some ways you can
            be involved in this are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning to identify and report pests/invasive species</li>
            <li>Participate in pest control organisations</li>
            <li>Support local trapping initiatives</li>
            <li>Practice responisble outdoor behaviour to prevent species spread</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Reducing your carbon footprint, this could be taking a bus rather then a car, using energy-efficent
                light bulbs, and avoiding food waste</li>
            <li>Support local conservation organizations</li>
            <li>Choose sustainable and locally-produced products</li>
            <li>Learn about Fiordland's ecological importance</li>

        <h3>Awareness</h3>
        <p>By learning and helping others to learn more about Fiordland and the complecations to its biodiversity,
            ecosystems and nature you learn about more ways to help, and be respectful and support the enviroment. Some
            ways to learn more are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Attend local conservation workshops</li>
            <li>Participate in guided nature tours</li>
            <li>Support educational programs about Fiordland's ecosystem</li>
            <li>Share your knowledge with friends and family</li>
            <li>Follow and support local conservation social media accounts</li>

        <h3>Financial support</h3>
        <p>Many conservation groups work very hard to support and care for the enviroment, but wihtout funding there is
            only so much that they can do. Donating and supporting these groups help them to make more of a positive
            impact as they are able to have more resources (this could be more trees to plant, more traps etc). </p>

        <h3>Respecting the culture</h3>
        <p>It is important to respect and acknowledge the culture and traditions of the people who came first, in Māori
            culture the land and nature are very important and are to be respected and treated well. This means
            practicing Kaitiakitanga, which is a Māori value about guardianship and care for the enviroment which
            embodies protecting the land, which is important for keeping Fiordland the way it is, allowing its natrual
            elements and beauty to come through!</p>
